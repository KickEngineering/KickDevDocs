<summary>What Is App Verification?</summary>

App Verification confirms that an application built on Kick is legitimate and trustworthy.\
Verified apps receive:

* Verified badge on bot account to help distinguish them from impersonators or misleading copycats.
* Increased chat subscription limits (from 1,000 → 10,000 subscriptions)

<summary>How do I request verification for my app/bot?</summary>

To request verification, email the Kick Developer Team at developers@kick.com and include:

* Client ID
* App Name
* Whether the bot also requires verification
* Reason for verification request (e.g., large/fast-growing user base, documented impersonation issues, need for expanded subscription capacity)
* Supporting evidence (e.g., public website/Chrome extension, active user metrics, impersonation examples, summary of the legitimate use case)
