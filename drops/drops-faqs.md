# Drops FAQs

## What are Drops?
Drops are rewards that viewers can earn by watching participating streams on Kick. Game developers offer these rewards to engage with their community and give viewers exclusive in-game items.

## How do I know if a stream has Drops enabled?
- On the category page, you'll see a Drops tag on the category image if Drops are enabled
- On a specific livestream, a timed message will appear in the chat window
- All campaigns associated with that streamer will show below the livestream video

## Do I need a Kick account to participate?
Yes, you need a Kick account to participate in Drops campaigns.

## Can I participate in Drops on mobile or different devices?
Yes, Drops watch time accumulation works on any device where you can access Kick.

## How do I track my progress toward earning a Drop?
You can see your live progress in two places:
- On the livestream page while watching
- In your Inventory on the Drops and Rewards page

## Do I need to watch a specific category/game?
Yes, the streamer must be streaming in the specific category that the campaign is running on for you to earn watch time toward that campaign's rewards.

## Can I earn Drops from multiple streams at the same time?
No, watching multiple tabs or streams simultaneously won't count progress for multiple campaigns at once. Only one stream will be counted toward your progress. However, if a single streamer has multiple campaigns running on their channel, you will accumulate watch time for all those campaigns simultaneously while watching that one stream.

## What happens if I switch between streams during a campaign?
Your progress carries over! Watch time earned on one stream toward a campaign will continue when you switch to another stream in the same category.

## Can I earn multiple rewards from the same campaign?
Yes, watch time is tracked per campaign. All rewards within that campaign track your watch time simultaneously, so you can earn multiple rewards as you reach different time milestones.

## When do I need to link my game account?
You can link your Kick account to your game account at any time by clicking the Connect button on either:
- Your Inventory page
- The All Campaigns page under campaign info

## What happens if I try to claim a reward without linking my accounts?
You'll see an error message. Make sure to connect your accounts before attempting to claim any rewards.

## Can I link multiple game accounts per game to my Kick account?
No, you can only link one Kick account to one game account per game.

## How do I unlink my game account?
You can unlink your connection to a game developer's OAuth app anytime by going to the Connections tab in your Settings.

## Where do I claim my earned rewards?
You can claim rewards in your Inventory once you've met the watch time requirements and linked your accounts.

## What happens if I don't claim my rewards in time?
If you don't claim within the grace period set by the game developers, rewards can no longer be claimed for that campaign.

## Can I see past Drops history?
Yes, you can view closed campaigns from the last 30 days in the All Campaigns tab.

## Can I see my past Drops history?
Yes, all the Drops that you have participated in show up in your Inventory. If you have claimed all the rewards for that campaign, it goes under the Claimed section. If the campaign has ended, it goes under the Expired section until the grace period is over. After the grace period is up, the campaign will no longer appear in your Inventory. You also stop accumulating watch time if a campaign is expired.

## What types of rewards can I earn through Drops?
Rewards vary by game and can include cosmetic items, in-game currency, exclusive skins, beta access, or other digital items determined by the game developers.

## My progress isn't tracking properly. What should I do?
Progress is tracked every 5 minutes, so avoid changing tabs or refreshing the page frequently. If issues persist, reach out to support@kick.com.

## The claim button isn't appearing. What's wrong?
The claim button will only appear when you've satisfied the watch time conditions. Make sure you've also connected your account before trying to claim.

## I claimed a reward but didn't receive it in-game. What should I do?
If you successfully claimed a reward but haven't received the item in-game, reach out to the game developer's support team directly.

## Who should I contact for Drops support?
- For general Drops issues: support@kick.com
- For reward fulfillment issues: Contact the game developer's support team
