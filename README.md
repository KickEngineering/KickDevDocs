# Welcome

Hey there! Welcome to the Kick Developer Docs 👋

You will find a range of features and documentation on how to integrate with the Kick API.

## A letter to the Developers

Hi :wave: Just want to let you know what we are working on in this closed beta phase, to keep you up to date with what might be changing during this phase, what is stable and what is to come.

### Feedback

We love contributions! Feel free to check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/KickEngineering/KickDevDocs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on submitting improvements or raising issues.

Following many other open-source projects, we will use GitHub as our central point of feedback, bug reports and feature requests for the API. All this documentation is stored within a repository which we will make publicly accessible, to allow the community to contribute to the project. We might even look at publishing a public road map there, but we aren't at that stage yet.

#### Short term feedback

Although we will be extremely active on the GitHub Issues on this repository, we will also provide a means for shorter feedback and discussion via a channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kick). Here you can ask questions, have discussions with the devs that have created the API or show off the cool things you've created. We are pretty opinionated people so there should be some great discussions on how to make this API and the community around it the best it can be!

## API Roadmap

We're rapidly building a world-class Public API with the following table highlighting the current status of various features available to developers.

Our goals during this phase is to get feedback and iterate quickly. We want to create a well-crafted, stable API that works together seamlessly which means we will be continually improving the API over the closed beta period based on your feedback.
